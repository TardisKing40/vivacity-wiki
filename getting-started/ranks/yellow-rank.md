### <mark style="color:yellow;">Player Particles</mark>

Player particles is accessed by the /pp menu in-game and with it, you can make 3 effects with almost endless combos. They only show when you are standing still (unless using specific moving styles like move) so they don't annoy you. When you enter the GUI, you pick a particle to use then a style for example. If I pick a note with orbit, I will end up with [this](http://m/). Some particles can have extra data such as color, like note and dust. [Here](http://m/) are only some of the styles.
